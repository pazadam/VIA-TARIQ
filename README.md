# VIA-TARIQ

**Analysing the long-term change and persistency of the Roman road system in the Levant**

The code stored in this repository is used to undertake research objectives defined in Work Packages 1 and 2 of the VIA-TARIQ project. These primarily focus on analysis of Roman road data and its reuse for least-cost path and network modelling to create a new highly-detailed predictive model of Roman road network in the Levant.
